Functions-1
#1.	Write a program that defines a function count_lower_upper() that accepts a string and calculates the number of uppercase and lowercase alphabets in it. It should return these values as a dictionary. Call this function for some sample string.
def count_lower_upper(string):
    lower = 0
    upper = 0
    for char in string:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char.islower():
                lower += 1
            else:
                upper += 1
    return {'upper': upper, 'lower': lower}

result = count_lower_upper(string)
print(result)

#2.	Write a program that defines a function compute() that calculates the value of n + nn + nnn + nnnn, where n is digit received by the function. test the function for digits 4 to 7.

    print(compute(i))

#3.	Write a program that defines a function create_array() to create and return a 3D array whose dimensions are passed to the function. Also initialize each element of this aray to a value passed to the function. e.g. create_array(3,4,5,n) where first three arguments are 3D array dimensions and 4th value is for initialing each value of the 3D array.

    return string == string[::-1]


string = "Hello There"

    for char in string:
        if char.isalpha():
            alpha += 1
        elif char.isdigit():
            digits += 1
    return {'alpha': alpha, 'digits': digits}

string = "Hello World! 123"
result = count_alpha_digits(string)
print(result)

#10.	Write a program that defines a function called frequency() which computes the frequency of words present in a string passed to it. The frequencies should be returned in sorted order of words in the string.
def frequency(string):
    words = string.split()
    freq = {}
    for word in words:
        freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1
    return sorted(freq.items())

string = "Quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
print(frequency(string))
